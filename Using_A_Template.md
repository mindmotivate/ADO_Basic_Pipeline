# Maven Template and .yml File

In this example, we use a Maven template. Maven is a powerful build automation and project management tool for Java projects. Templates in Azure Pipelines are pre-configured build definitions that serve as starting points for common scenarios.

## Maven:

Think of Maven as a recipe book for baking a cake. When you want to bake a cake, you follow a recipe that specifies the ingredients and the steps to take. Maven does the same for software projects. It manages and organizes the various "ingredients" (code, libraries, and resources) needed to build a software application. Maven ensures that everything is in the right place, just like a recipe guides you to have the right elements for a delicious cake.

## YAML (.yml):

Imagine YAML as a to-do list for a day's tasks. Each task is a step you need to complete, and the list is structured in a way that's easy to read. Similarly, a YAML file is like a structured checklist for a computer program. It outlines the tasks a program should perform and the order in which to execute them. This makes it easy for both humans and computers to understand and follow the sequence of actions needed to accomplish a specific goal.

A `.yml` file, or YAML file, is a human-readable data serialization format. In Azure Pipelines, it acts as a configuration file that defines the steps and settings of your pipeline. When using a Maven template, a `.yml` file is generated, encapsulating instructions for building and deploying your Java application. During the pipeline setup, you'll see and interact with this YAML file on the screen, allowing customization based on your project's needs.
