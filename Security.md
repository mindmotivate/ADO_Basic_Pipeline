# Enhancing Security in Your Pipeline

To fortify the security measures in your pipeline, you can include tasks for Axivion, Acunetix, and Snyk. Following the steps below will help you seamlessly integrate these security tasks into your pipeline:

## Importance of Security Tasks in the Pipeline:

1. ## **Axivion:**
   - **Purpose:** Axivion ensures code quality and compliance with coding standards.
   - **Importance:** Early detection of code quality issues and adherence to standards enhances the overall reliability of your application.
   
2. ## **Acunetix:**
   - **Purpose:** Acunetix is a web vulnerability scanner, focusing on identifying security issues in web applications.
   - **Importance:** Regular scanning helps uncover vulnerabilities, providing an additional layer of defense against potential cyber threats.

3. ## **Snyk:**
   - **Purpose:** Snyk scans your Java project for known security vulnerabilities and offers actionable recommendations.
   - **Importance:** Preventing exploitation of known vulnerabilities ensures a more secure Java project.

# Layered Defense Strategy:

The selection of the order for security tasks in your pipeline is a strategic decision that aligns with the principles of building a secure and robust software development lifecycle. Let's explore the reasoning behind the chosen order:

## Axivion: Ensuring Code Quality and Standards Compliance
- **Purpose:** Axivion focuses on analyzing and ensuring code quality while adhering to coding standards.
- **Order Rationale:** Initiating with Axivion addresses foundational aspects of code quality. By establishing compliance with standards, the subsequent security measures can build on a solid coding foundation.

## Acunetix: Identifying Web Application Vulnerabilities
- **Purpose:** Acunetix specializes in scanning web applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Order Rationale:** Following Axivion, Acunetix concentrates on external-facing components. This order allows for the identification of potential vulnerabilities in web applications, enhancing the overall security posture.

## Snyk: Scanning for Known Security Vulnerabilities
- **Purpose:** Snyk scans the Java project for known security vulnerabilities and provides actionable recommendations.
- **Order Rationale:** Concluding with Snyk ensures a comprehensive check for known vulnerabilities. By placing it last, you leverage the insights gained from Axivion and Acunetix, addressing both internal and external vulnerabilities.

## Strategic Layered Defense
The chosen order forms a strategic layered defense:
1. Establish internal code quality.
2. Address vulnerabilities in web applications.
3. Check for known security issues comprehensively.

This sequence minimizes the risk of overlooking critical aspects, offering a systematic approach to building secure software throughout the development lifecycle.
