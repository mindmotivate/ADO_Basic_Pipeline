# Simplified YAML File Breakdown

# Disclaimer

Azure DevOps (ADO) automatically generates this pipeline code for you. The following is a basic breakdown of what this code is doing:

- **Trigger:** The pipeline initiates when changes are made to the 'main' branch.

- **Agent Pool:** This is like the computer where our pipeline operates, a virtual workspace. In this case, it's using the latest version of Ubuntu as the operating system.

- **Maven Build Step:** This is the core of our pipeline. Maven, our building assistant, is instructed on how to build our Java project.
  - `mavenPomFile`: Specifies the location of our project settings.
  - `mavenOptions`: Additional settings for Maven, such as memory usage.
  - `javaHomeOption`: Determines the version of Java to use.
  - `jdkVersionOption`: Specifies the version of Java.
  - `jdkArchitectureOption`: Specifies the architecture of the Java version.
  - `publishJUnitResults`: Ensures the publication of JUnit test results.
  - `testResultsFiles`: Specifies the location of test result files.
  - `goals`: Defines Maven tasks, in this case, 'package' for building our Java project.
  
**Note:** While understanding this breakdown is helpful, ADO's automated generation simplifies the process, making it more accessible for users without extensive coding knowledge.



```yaml
# Maven Build Pipeline

# Trigger
# The pipeline kicks off when changes are made to the 'main' branch.

trigger:
- main

# Agent Pool
# This is like the computer where our pipeline does its work. 
# Think of it as a virtual workspace. Here, it's using the latest version of Ubuntu as its operating system.

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# Build Steps
steps:

  # Maven Build Step
  # This is the heart of our pipeline where we tell Maven how to build our Java project.

  - task: Maven@3
    inputs:
      # Maven Project File
      # This tells Maven where our project settings are.
      mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'

      # Maven Options
      # These are extra settings for Maven, like how much memory it can use.
      mavenOptions: '-Xmx3072m'

      # JDK Configuration
      # This tells Maven which version of Java to use.
      javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
      jdkVersionOption: '1.8'
      jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'

      # Publish Test Results
      # This makes sure we can see the results of our tests.
      publishJUnitResults: true
      testResultsFiles: '**/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'

      # Maven Goals
      # These are the tasks Maven will perform. 
      # In this case, it's like telling Maven to build our Java project into a package.
      goals: 'package'
