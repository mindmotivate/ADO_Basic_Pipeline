# Save and Run:
Once you're satisfied with the YAML (your recipe), you save it. This is like finalizing your cooking instructions. After saving, you initiate a "run," which is akin to starting the cooking process.

# Commit to Repository:
When you run the pipeline, you're prompted to commit (save officially) your YAML file to your project's repository. It's like recording your recipe in a cookbook so you can use it again.

# Understanding Your Azure Pipelines Run Summary

This screen is like a report card for your automated process, created using Azure Pipelines. Let's break it down:

1. **Run Information (Top Section):**
   - **Run ID:** #20231231.1 is a unique identifier for this specific run, like a ticket number.
   - **Pipeline Name:** pipelines-java is the name of the pipeline that's doing the work.
   - **Run New Button:** Allows you to manually trigger a new run of this pipeline.

2. **Run Retention Information:**
   - This run is being kept for reference as one of the three most recent runs related to the 'main' branch.
   - You can view retention leases to understand more about why and how long it's being retained.

3. **Summary Section:**
   - **Tests and Code Coverage:** Indicates the health of your code. 100% passed means everything is working well.
   - **Axivion Report, Acunetix 360 Scan Report, Snyk Report:** Additional reports providing insights into code quality and security.

4. **Triggered By:**
   - This run was initiated by someone named "Motivated Mind." This could be a person or an automated process.

5. **Repository and Version Information:**
   - **Repository:** pipelines-java is the project or codebase this pipeline is managing.
   - **Branch:** 'main' is the version of the code currently being processed.
   - **Commit ID (e.g., 850da19e):** A unique identifier for the specific version of the code.

6. **Time Information:**
   - **Time Started and Elapsed:** Shows when the process began (Just now) and how long it's been running (28 seconds).

7. **Related Work Items and Artifacts:**
   - Displays any related tasks, work items, or artifacts connected to this run.

In simple terms, this screen tells you how well your automated pipeline is performing. The green lights (100% passed) are like getting an A+ on your project, and the reports provide additional insights into the health and security of your code. Someone named "Motivated Mind" triggered this process, and it's currently running smoothly.
